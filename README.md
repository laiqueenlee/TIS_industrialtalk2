# Report



# Reflection
I am very inspired by Ms Qistinaâ€™s talk. Her valuable insights in this talk have educated me on the role an analyst and the tasks that they would have to undertake. As of the topic of system development, this talk certainly sparked my interest in further learning about it. I plan to deepen my understanding of it and refine my skills in system development methodologies in the next four years.
